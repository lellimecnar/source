Here are some additional guidelines:

- Write extensive documentation both in markdown file(s) and as comments in the code.
- Use test-driven development (TDD), writing comprehensive tests before writing any code.
- Test your code thoroughly, including edge cases and error handling.
- Use descriptive variable and function names, following the camelCase convention.
- Use `is`, `has`, and `can` prefixes for boolean properties, variables, and boolean-returning methods.
- Use `get` and `set` prefixes for properties and methods that return or modify values.
- Use getters and setters for properties that are read-only, have complex logic, or need to be truly private.
