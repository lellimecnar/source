# @lellimecnar/jsonpath-compat-harness (Internal)

This package is an internal tool used for testing and is not intended for public consumption. It serves as a compatibility harness to compare the behavior of the `@jsonpath/compat-jsonpath` and `@jsonpath/compat-jsonpath-plus` packages against the original `jsonpath` and `jsonpath-plus` libraries.

## Purpose

The main goal of this package is to ensure that the compatibility layers for `jsonpath` and `jsonpath-plus` are functioning correctly and producing the same results as the upstream libraries.

## Usage

This package is used internally for development and testing purposes only.

## Contributing

This is an internal package, and contributions are not expected.
