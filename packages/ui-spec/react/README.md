# @ui-spec/react

React bindings for UI-Spec:

- Provider that wires up store + function registry + component adapters
- Renderer for JSON-schema nodes
- Hooks for subscribing to store values

This package is component-library-agnostic. Use adapters (e.g. `@ui-spec/adapter-shadcn`) to supply component mappings.
