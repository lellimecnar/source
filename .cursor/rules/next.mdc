- You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 15 App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Turborepo monorepo patterns.

- Code Style and Structure

  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

- Naming Conventions

  - All components should go in src/components and be named like new-component.tsx
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

- TypeScript Usage

  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

- Syntax and Formatting

  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.

- UI and Styling

  - Use Shadcn UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

- Performance Optimization

  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

- Monorepo Context

  - This is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo
  - Use workspace packages: `@lellimecnar/ui`, `@lellimecnar/utils`
  - Next.js apps must transpile `@lellimecnar/ui` in `next.config.js`:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      reactStrictMode: true,
      transpilePackages: ['@lellimecnar/ui'],
    };
    ```
  - Turborepo handles build dependencies - `build` tasks depend on `^build`
  - Use shared configs: `@lellimecnar/typescript-config/next.json`, `@lellimecnar/tailwind-config`

- UI Component Library

  - Use `@lellimecnar/ui` for all base UI components
  - Import components using granular exports for tree-shaking:
    ```typescript
    import { Button } from '@lellimecnar/ui/button'
    import { Input } from '@lellimecnar/ui/input'
    import { Page } from '@lellimecnar/ui/page'
    ```
  - Always import global CSS in root layout:
    ```typescript
    import '@lellimecnar/ui/global.css'
    ```
  - Use ThemeProvider for dark mode support:
    ```typescript
    import { ThemeProvider } from '@lellimecnar/ui/theme'
    ```

- Key Conventions

  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  - Follow Next.js 15 docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
  - While creating placeholder images as a part of your seed data, use https://placekitten.com/
  - Place both the /app and /components folders under a /src directory. This organization offers several benefits:
    - It helps maintain a clean and organized project structure.
    - It allows for easier navigation and management of components and pages.
    - It adheres to common industry standards, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
    - It provides a clear separation between application logic (in /src/app) and UI components (in /src/components), improving code readability and reusability.
    - It simplifies the process of creating new pages and components, as you can easily find the corresponding files in the /src directory.
    - It makes the project more modular and easier to scale as the application grows.
    - It adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, where different aspects of the application are handled by different directories.

## Components Organization

Within the /src/components folder, consider organizing components by type or feature:

By Type: Group components like forms, buttons, layout elements, etc.

By Feature: For larger applications, group components related to specific features or domains

For example:

  /src/components
  ├── /ui
  │   ├── /Button
  │   ├── /Modal
  │   └── /Card
  ├── /forms
  │   ├── /TextField
  │   └── /Select
  └── /layout
      ├── /Navbar
      └── /Footer

- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a _components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.

- Shared Components: The /src/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.

- Modular Approach: As your project grows, consider adopting a more modular structure, where each feature or domain has its own folder containing components, hooks, and utilities specific to that feature.

- Documentation Requirements

  - Update AGENTS.md when adding new major features or changing architecture
  - Document new routes in AGENTS.md
  - Keep package.json dependencies in sync with AGENTS.md
  - Document any deviations from standard patterns

- Package Exports

  - When creating shared utilities, consider if they belong in `@lellimecnar/utils`
  - When creating reusable UI components, consider if they belong in `@lellimecnar/ui`
  - Use granular exports for better tree-shaking
  - Document exports in package AGENTS.md files
